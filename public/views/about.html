                        <br>
                        <br> I don’t like to limit myself to developing with particular tools or technologies, but I’m experienced with <span>Android Studio</span>, <span>Xcode</span>, <span>Unity</span>, <span>Gamesalad</span>, <span>Qt</span>, <span>Sketch</span>, <span>Ionic</span> and <span>Arduino</span>. I’m pretty devoted to making the world a better place: This means I believe in technology can solve any problem.
                        <br>
                        I love leveraging build tools and automating every process I can. I enjoy experimenting with new technology and incorporating it into my workflow when appropriate. I love <span>open source</span> and find great value in metrics, especially in terms of performance.
                        <br>
                        Apart from technology, I also like <span>painting</span> and <span>music</span>. A lot.

                        <p class="para">
                            After learning <span>Python</span> in my first year, I discovered my passion is “<span>Creating solutions with technology</span>”. In my 2nd year, I joined <span>Coding Club</span> that helped me to connect with like-minded people in college. I started learning <span>Game Development</span> and created a 3D shooter in my college arena and some 2D games for my college fest. I didn’t restrict myself to club activities, but developed my skills as <span>App Developer both Android and iOS, writing backend codes, develop ing desktop softwares, creating Hybrid Apps, making my own UI, exploring Arduino and Raspberry Pie, and last but not least writing <a href="http://www.blogofcodes.com" target="_blank">blog</a> to keep track of what I learnt new</span>. It took some time to understand that making apps is more than writing codes. It’s about solving problems. In my final year of college I’m exploring the concepts of <span>Data Analytics using R</span> and some other interesting projects.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>Curiosity</span> has been my biggest teacher. I explore the internet to learn <span>techniques</span> and <span>best practices</span>, and according to me formal education just slowed this process of self-learning. I spend 80% of my time learning things that interest me. Be it new tools, new languages, frameworks, codes or design practices. The remaining is implementation and take feedback from real users. <span>Sleepless nights</span> for pushing an update, that’s what I live for.

                            I believe that <span>technology will change everything</span>. I already see that happening but in future embed it even deeper in our life. technology is <span>empowering everything we do</span>, therefore it’s becoming more complex. Users have more options and less patience for the content. For me it is fascinating how all this fits together.
